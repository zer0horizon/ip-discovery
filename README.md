Detect your public IP address using DNS, STUN, or HTTP — with built-in fallback across trusted providers.

## Why ip-discovery?

Most machines don't know their own public IP. If you're behind NAT, a load balancer, or a cloud VPC, your OS only sees a private address like `10.x.x.x` or `192.168.x.x`. This library solves that — reliably, fast, and with zero configuration.

**Common use cases:**

- **Self-hosted servers with dynamic IPs** — Your home server or office NAS gets a new IP every time the ISP rotates it. Use `ip-discovery` to detect the change and update your DNS record (dynamic DNS), notify clients, or refresh firewall rules — automatically.

- **WebRTC / P2P connection setup** — When building WebRTC applications, you need your public IP to generate SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates. `ip-discovery` uses the same STUN protocol that browsers use, giving you the public-facing address for direct peer connections without relying on a browser environment.

- **NAT traversal & hole punching** — Building a peer-to-peer system (game server, file sharing, VPN)? You need to know your public IP and the type of NAT you're behind before you can punch through it.

- **Server self-registration** — Microservices or edge nodes that spin up in dynamic cloud environments (auto-scaling groups, spot instances) and need to register their public address with a service registry or coordination layer.

- **Security & audit logging** — Record the public IP of the machine at the time of an event for compliance or forensics. Use `Consensus` strategy to cross-verify across multiple providers and guard against a single provider being spoofed.

- **CLI diagnostics** — Quickly check "what IP does the internet see me as?" during debugging, without opening a browser or remembering which `curl` endpoint to hit.

### Why not just `curl` an IP-echo service?

Calling a single HTTP endpoint works for a quick manual check, but falls short in production:

| | HTTP IP-echo services | `ip-discovery` |
|---|---|---|
| **Single point of failure** | If that one service is down or slow, you get nothing | Automatic fallback across 9 providers and 3 protocols |
| **Rate limiting** | Many free services aggressively throttle or block automated requests | DNS and STUN are lightweight UDP queries — far less likely to be throttled than HTTP APIs |
| **Latency** | Full TCP + TLS handshake every time (~200–500ms) | DNS & STUN use raw UDP — typically **<50ms**, 2–3× faster |
| **Result verification** | You trust one provider blindly — it could return stale data or be spoofed | `Consensus` strategy cross-checks across multiple providers |
| **IPv6 support** | Depends on the endpoint; many only return IPv4 | First-class IPv4 and IPv6 support across DNS and STUN |
| **Dependency in code** | Needs shell-out or an HTTP client just to get an IP | Embeddable Rust library, no HTTP dependency needed (DNS + STUN only) |
| **Offline-friendly** | Requires an HTTP-capable environment / TLS stack | DNS and STUN work in minimal environments with just UDP |

> **💡 Note:** Some strict enterprise networks block outbound UDP entirely. In those environments, DNS and STUN won't work.
> Enable the `http` feature to add HTTP-based providers as a fallback — the library will automatically
> try them if UDP-based providers fail.

## CLI Tool — `ipd`

A command-line tool powered by this library. Get your public IP in one command:

```bash
$ ipd
203.0.113.42
```

### Install

**Homebrew (macOS):**

```bash
brew install zer0horizon/tap/ipd
```

**Shell (macOS & Linux):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/zer0horizon/ip-discovery/releases/latest/download/ipd-installer.sh | sh
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/zer0horizon/ip-discovery/releases/latest/download/ipd-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

**Cargo:**

```bash
cargo install ipd
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
ipd                    # Plain IP output
ipd -4                 # IPv4 only
ipd -6                 # IPv6 only
ipd -f json            # JSON output
ipd -f verbose         # Verbose output with provider info
ipd -s race            # Race all providers, return fastest
ipd -p dns -p stun     # Use only DNS and STUN protocols
ipd -t 5               # 5 second timeout
```

## Library

### Features

- DNS and STUN via raw UDP sockets (zero network library dependencies)
- HTTP/HTTPS via [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest) (optional)
- Built-in providers from Google, Cloudflare, AWS, and OpenDNS
- IPv4 and IPv6
- Sequential fallback, race, or consensus strategies
- Custom providers via the `Provider` trait
- Async, built on [tokio](https://tokio.rs)

## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ip-discovery = "0.2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Then:

```rust
use ip_discovery::get_ip;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let result = get_ip().await?;
    println!("{} via {} in {:?}", result.ip, result.provider, result.latency);
    Ok(())
}
```

You can also request a specific IP version:

```rust
use ip_discovery::{get_ipv4, get_ipv6};

let v4 = get_ipv4().await?;
let v6 = get_ipv6().await?;
```

## Configuration

The defaults (Cloudflare STUN → Cloudflare DNS → Google STUN/DNS → OpenDNS; 10s timeout) work well for most cases. If you need more control:

```rust
use ip_discovery::{Config, Strategy, Protocol, BuiltinProvider, get_ip_with};
use std::time::Duration;

// DNS only, race all DNS providers
let config = Config::builder()
    .protocols(&[Protocol::Dns])
    .strategy(Strategy::Race)
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
    .build();

let result = get_ip_with(config).await?;
```

```rust
// Pick specific providers
let config = Config::builder()
    .providers(&[
        BuiltinProvider::CloudflareDns,
        BuiltinProvider::GoogleStun,
    ])
    .build();
```

```rust
// Consensus — require at least 2 providers to agree
let config = Config::builder()
    .strategy(Strategy::Consensus { min_agree: 2 })
    .build();
```

## Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `First` *(default)* | Try providers in order, return first success |
| `Race` | Query all concurrently, return fastest |
| `Consensus { min_agree }` | Require N providers to agree on the same IP |

## Providers

All built-in providers are from tier-1 infrastructure companies:

| Provider | Protocol | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|----------|----------|:----:|:----:|
| Google STUN (`stun.l.google.com`) | STUN | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google STUN 1 (`stun1.l.google.com`) | STUN | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google STUN 2 (`stun2.l.google.com`) | STUN | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cloudflare STUN (`stun.cloudflare.com`) | STUN | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google DNS (`o-o.myaddr.l.google.com`) | DNS | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cloudflare DNS (`whoami.cloudflare`) | DNS | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenDNS (`myip.opendns.com`) | DNS | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cloudflare HTTP (`1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace`) | HTTP | ✅ | ❌ |
| AWS (`checkip.amazonaws.com`) | HTTP | ✅ | ❌ |

## Cargo Features

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|:-------:|-------------|
| `dns` | ✅ | DNS detection (raw UDP, no extra deps) |
| `stun` | ✅ | STUN detection (raw UDP, no extra deps) |
| `http` | ❌ | HTTP detection (pulls in `reqwest` + `rustls`) |
| `all` | ❌ | Enable all protocols (`dns` + `stun` + `http`) |
| `native-tls` | ❌ | Use OS-native TLS instead of rustls (requires `http`) |

By default, only DNS and STUN are enabled — zero network library dependencies, fast compile times. To also use HTTP providers:

```toml
ip-discovery = { version = "0.2", features = ["http"] }
```

Or enable everything:

```toml
ip-discovery = { version = "0.2", features = ["all"] }
```

## Performance

STUN and DNS use raw UDP — no TLS handshake — so they're typically 2–3× faster than HTTP.
Default provider order prioritizes UDP-based protocols with IPv4 + IPv6 support first, then falls back to IPv4-only HTTP providers.

> **💡 Tip:** Latency varies significantly by region and network environment. Run the benchmark on
> your own infrastructure to find the optimal provider and strategy for your use case.

```bash
# Run the benchmark to find the best config for your network
cargo run --example benchmark --all-features
```

## Logging

Uses [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing) for diagnostics:

```rust
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .with_env_filter("ip_discovery=debug")
    .init();
```

## Examples

```bash
cargo run --example simple
cargo run --example custom_providers
cargo run --example benchmark
```

## MSRV
